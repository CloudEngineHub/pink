**P**ython **in**verse **k**inematics for your robot model based on [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio).

## üèóÔ∏è Upcoming changes

Pink is under active development and its API is **not stable**. Expect the following upcoming changes:

- Add posture task to Upkie example
- v0.4: Handle models without and with floating base
- Add a manipulator example
- Reformulate task gains as time constants

And more, all [contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcome :)

## Installation

First, install [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio), for instance by ``pip install pin``.

Then install Pink by:

```sh
pip install pin-pink
```

## History

Pink implements the same task-based inverse kinematics as [pymanoid](https://github.com/stephane-caron/pymanoid), but it is much simpler to install and runs faster thanks to Pinocchio. Its internal math is summarized in [this note](https://scaron.info/robot-locomotion/inverse-kinematics.html). If you find yourself needing to read that in order to use the library, it means the API has abstraction leakage, please open an issue :-)
